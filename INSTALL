To build for the current system, run:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

================================================================================

Many additional configuration options can be seen by running:

	./configure --help

================================================================================

To build for Tomato, once the toolchain and build environment are set up
(including dependencies all the dependencies, see README), run:

	./configure \
		--build=`gcc -dumpmachine` \
		--host=mipsel-linux-uclibc \
		--target=mipsel-linux-uclibc \
		--prefix=/jffs \
		--enable-custom-permanent-iface-blacklist-regex='^vlan1$' \
		--enable-custom-iptables-path=/usr/sbin/iptables \
		--enable-dnsmasq-lease-lookup \
		--enable-custom-agent-type=tomato_source
	make
	make install

To build for OpenWRT, we have provided a wiomw package feed which can be used
like any other OpenWRT package feed. For more information on how to use OpenWRT
package feeds, visit <http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/feeds>. To use our
feed, add the following line to your feeds.conf:

	src-hg wiomw https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.whoisonmywifi.com/downloads/openwrt/feeds/wiomw.hg

For routers running 12.09 (Attitude Adjustment) with more limited flash space,
we have also provided another feed which contains a backported version (from
OpenWRT trunk) of libcurl built with PolarSSL support rather than the official
libcurl package for 12.09 which has OpenSSL as a dependency (OpenSSL alone is
~600K compressed on ar71xx, which is huge on a router with ~800K of free
space). To use this feed as well, also add the following line to your
feeds.conf:

	src-hg backport_curl_polarssl https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.whoisonmywifi.com/downloads/openwrt/feeds/backport_curl_polarssl.hg
