Who Is On My WiFi Linux

Who Is On My WiFi is a software-as-a-service solution to monitor network
devices for small businesses and home users. Network data is collected from
any of a variety of "agents" and sent to our cloud servers for collection and
processing. From there, network owners can be notified by any of several means
(including text message) of the presence of any unknown devices. Additionally,
in certain circumstances, administrators can prevent a device from accessing
the network by toggling the block flag for the device on the website.

Who Is On My WiFi Linux is a Who Is On My WiFi agent that uses some of the
capabilities of the Linux kernel to perform its scanning. It was designed to be
used on Linux-based wireless routers (e.g. WRT54G running Tomato firmware,
OpenWRT-based routers), but the scanning functionality should work on most
Linux-based devices where the relevant functionality of the Linux kernel can be
accessed (e.g. desktops, servers, certain other embedded devices). When run on
a router, this agent provides the most effective and most efficient blocking
capabilities of any Who Is On My WiFi agent.
